## June 24: Initial ideas and goal of the project

I always like to begin engineering projects by setting a goal. For this project, my goal is the following:

**To learn and have fun by building a launchpad and catch tower for the Starkit electric model rocket**

Based on my vision for this project, I've set some design requirements. This way, I will try to find the most efficient and cost-effective way possible of creating something that I'll be happy with:

### Design requirements

These are the absolute musts that a design should have:

- The launchpad can clamp on the rocket until ful throttle is reached
- The launchpad has rails to guide the rocket after liftoff
- The tower can catch the rocket for landing

	*I want to build a tower to catch the rocket for landing, similar to what SpaceX does with their SuperHeavy booster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGC31lmdS6s 

### Dream goals

These are not essential but they'd be cool to have:

- The launchpad can automatically launch the rocket after a catch
	- The tower can place the rocket on the launch mount
	- Hold down clamps can engage automatically
	- The launchpad can recharge the rocket while on the launch mount
- The launchpad looks as similar to Starship's launchpad and as cool as possible
	- The launchpad has got a countdown display

**Time spent: 45min**

## June 25: Research on landing methods

I've decided to start by researching the feasibility of catching Starkit between the tower arms, which would require precise data about the relative position between the two. I've come to the conclusion that it is feasible and I've decided to use a camera on the rocket to track a beacon on the launchpad. This should give the rocket enough information to accurately approach the tower, and it should give the tower enough information to close its arms in the exact position the rocket is at. I will have to do more research to figure out all of the details, but now that I know that it is feasible I will start designing the launchpad.

I've decided to start by designing the
